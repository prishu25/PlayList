# PlayList
Hi Sagar,
Please let me know if there is problem in code or if you want some change in the code
Things that I covered in my code:
Note:I have taken 10-11 song . You can add more.
1.Every time when  my application run for the first time it will fetch the last song played from the text file
 (you have to change the locaton of file before running the code)
2.If last saved song is deleted from playlist it give corresponding message
3. I have suffled the song in the playlist so each time You will hear different song
4. Next and previous button works as usual
5.Previous button is disable for First song in Playlist
6. Next button is disable for Last Song in Playlist.
7.Same Song will not be played twice.
8.Every time you play a song it will be updated in text file
